## Project Overview

This project is a starter template for a school or educational website created using **React** and **TypeScript**.  
It mimics the layout and feel of the DPS Bangalore website with sections such as:

- Navigation bar
- Hero / Landing section with school slogan
- Core values and philosophy
- Academics overview
- Facilities offered
- Upcoming events
- Admissions process
- Contact form
- Footer

The template uses clean, modular components to make editing and expansion straightforward for developers of all skill levels.

---

## Features

- Built with **React** and **TypeScript** for type safety and modern development.
- Modular component-based design for easy customization.
- Sections for typical educational websites:
  - Navbar, Hero, Values, Academics, Facilities, Events, Admissions, Contact, Footer.
- Responsive layout (can be enhanced with CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS or your choice).
- Development server with hot-reloading for fast iteration (`npm start`).
- Production build optimization (`npm run build`).
- Example styling included with utility class names (for Tailwind CSS, but easily adaptable).

---

## Demo

You can run the project locally following the steps below or deploy on platforms like Vercel or Netlify.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 14 or above recommended)
- `npm` (comes bundled with Node.js)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repo)

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Kamalc503/my-school-website.git
cd my-school-website
```

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Running Locally

Start the development server:

```
npm start
```

Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the website.  
The page will reload automatically when you edit any source files.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized static files in the `build/` directory that you can deploy to any static hosting service.
